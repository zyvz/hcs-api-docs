    # HouseCanary Analytics API Documentation


    Welcome to the [HouseCanary Analytics
    API](https://www.housecanary.com/products/data-points/)! You can use the
    HouseCanary Analytics API to access HouseCanary's proprietary analytics as
    well as public records data.


    ## Making Requests


    ### URL structure


    The HouseCanary API is based on
    [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).


    Each request URL has a form: `{BASE}/{ENDPOINT}`


    The base URL of the API is https://api.housecanary.com


    Each endpoint follows the form: `{VERSION}/{LEVEL}/{TARGET}`, where
    `{VERSION}` is either v2 or v3, and where `{LEVEL}` is one of:


    | Level      | Description                                                 |

    | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

    | property   | Individual property: a building or a unit within a building |

    | block      | US-census block                                             |

    | blockgroup | US-census block group                                       |

    | zip        | US zipcode                                                  |

    | metrodiv   | US-census Metropolitan Division                             |

    | msa        | US-census Metropolitan Statistical Area                     |

    | state      | US State                                                    |


    and `{TARGET}` is the data descriptor such as `value`, `rental_value`,
    `details`, etc.


    Note that while most HouseCanary endpoints are v2 urls, there are a few new
    endpoints that utilize v3. Be sure to check each endpoint's documentation to
    confirm the correct base URL structure and version.


    **Example (v2):** `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/property/value` has the
    version `v2`, level `property`, and a target of `value`, which comprise an
    endpoint `v2/property/value`.


    **Example (v3):** `https://api.housecanary.com/v3/property/hoa_est` has the
    version `v3`, level `property`, and a target of `hoa_est`, which comprise an
    endpoint `v3/property/hoa_est`.


    For brevity, we will skip the base URL in most of this document. If the
    shown URL starts with the slash, the corresponding full URL can always be
    obtained by prepending it with the base URL.


    ### Requests


    Each request URL allows accessing data for items that belong to the URL's
    [level](#url-structure). Items can be specified by these
    [identifiers](#levels-and-identifiers).


    - Data for a single item can be retrieved with a [`GET`
    request](#get-requests) by specifying item identifiers in the query string.

    - Data for multiple items can be retrieved in bulk using a single [`POST`
    request](#post-requests) by specifying a sequence of item identifiers in the
    JSON-encoded body.


    In both cases, the requested items are always members of the same level,
    that of the URL.


    ### Responses


    The responses to both `GET` and `POST` requests are JSON arrays representing
    the sequence of data chunks, one chunk for each requested item, preserving
    the request sequence order:


    - A response to the [`GET` request](#get-requests) will contain a single
    chunk, because the single item was requested.

    - A response to the [`POST` request](#post-requests) will contain as many
    chunks as there were items in the requested sequence.


    ## Authentication


    In order to use the HouseCanary API, you must obtain a credentials pair
    (`API Key`, `API Secret`) from your [settings
    page](https://platform.housecanary.com/api-settings).


    Authentication of API requests is made using [HTTP Basic
    Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
    Use your `API Key` as the user name and your `API Secret` as the password
    for Basic Authentication. HTTPS must be used for all API requests. See the
    full request examples below that show how to authenticate with the API in
    various programming languages.


    For Authentication failure information, see
    [here](#401-authentication-failures).


    ### Test Credentials


    Test credentials are useful for verifying functionality in a development or
    staging environment. In order to generate test credentials (`API Key`, `API
    Secret`), go to your [settings
    page](https://platform.housecanary.com/api-settings) and use the “New Test
    API Key” link.


    Your test credentials can be used to make test requests. The HouseCanary API
    maintains a whitelist of items that can be used in test requests. For more
    information on retrieving this whitelist, see [here](#test-lists).


    ## Permissions


    To use the HouseCanary Analytics API, your user account must have
    permissions enabled for all API components that you want to access. You can
    check which components you have enabled in the “Analytics API” section of
    the [API settings](https://platform.housecanary.com/api-settings). If you
    have any questions about the components you have access to, contact
    [support](https://support.housecanary.com/).


    ## Levels and Identifiers


    Different identifiers are used depending on the level of the URL. For
    example, properties are identified by their addresses, while residential
    blocks are identified by their census block IDs. The possible identifiers
    for each level are:


    - `property`: any combination of `address`, `unit`, `state`, `city`, and
    `zipcode` that identifies the US address. Usually, this is `address` and
    `zipcode` or `address`, `city`, `state`. Also, a `slug` can be used.

    - `block`: a `block_id`.

    - `blockgroup`: a `blockgroup_id`.

    - `zip`: a `zipcode`.

    - `metrodiv`: a `metrodiv`.

    - `msa`: an `msa`.

    - `state`: a 2-letter acronym of the US state.


    All possible identifiers and their descriptions are listed below:


    | Identifier      |
    Description

    ## GET Requests


    Using a `GET` request, you can retrieve data for a single item from an
    endpoint by specifying item identifiers in the query parameters.


    ### GET URL Format


    `GET https://api.housecanary.com/{VERSION}/{ENDPOINT}?{IDENTIFIERS}`


    - `{VERSION}` is the version relevant to the endpoint you are calling,
    either `v2` or `v3`.

    - `{ENDPOINT}` is the specific endpoint you are calling, such as
    `property/value`.

    - `{IDENTIFIERS}` is the URL-encoded string providing item identifiers as an
    ampersand-separated list of key=value pairs. Exact identifiers depend on the
    level of the URL, see [Levels and Identifiers](#levels-and-identifiers).


    Example URL separated into constituent segments:


    - `{BASE}: https://api.housecanary.com`

    - `{VERSION}: v2/`

    - `{ENDPOINT}: zip/details`

    - `{IDENTIFIERS}: zipcode=01234`


    Then, combined together:


    `{BASE}/{ENDPOINT}?{IDENTIFIERS}`:


    `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/zip/details?zipcode=01234`


    Example GET URLs:


    -
    `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/property/geocode?address=10216+N+Willow+Ave&zipcode=64157`

    -
    `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/property/value?address=10216+N+Willow+Ave&zipcode=64157`

    -
    `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/property/value?address=65239+Rosanne+Prairie+St&city=Bayardchester&state=CA`

    -
    `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/property/rental_value?slug=65239-Rosanne-Prairie-Bayardchester-CA-90113`

    -
    `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/block/value_distribution?block_id=012345678901234`

    - `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/zip/details?zipcode=01234`

    - `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/msa/hpi_ts?msa=09876`


    ## POST Requests


    Using a POST request, you can retrieve data for multiple items by specifying
    a sequence of item identifiers in the POST body. We strongly recommend using
    POST requests for batching whenever possible.


    _Note: POST requests are only supported for the Analytics API. Value Report,
    Rental Report, and Value Analysis do not support POST requests._


    ### POST URL Format


    `POST https://api.housecanary.com/{VERSION}/{ENDPOINT}`


    `{VERSION}` is the version relevant to the endpoint you are calling, either
    `v2` or `v3`.


    `{ENDPOINT}` is the specific endpoint you are calling, such as
    `property/geocode`.


    Example POST URL format:


    - `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/property/geocode`

    -
    `https://api.housecanary.com/v2/property/component_mget?components=property/details,property/value`


    ### POST Body


    All POST requests must have the Content-Type header set to
    `application/json` and the POST body must be a valid json array representing
    a sequence of requested item identifiers.


    There is a limit of 100 items per POST request (i.e. 100 address + zipcode
    combinations, or 100 block_ids).


    All items in a single POST request must have the same set of keys. For
    property-level POST requests, either `address` or `slug` keys must be
    present for all items so HouseCanary can identify the specific properties.


    Each item in the json array must contain one or more of the following keys:


    | Level     | Key           | Required? |
    Description

    Contact us or view API Settings for custom rate limits.


    Rate limits differ between the Analytics API endpoints and the Value Report
    endpoints. Rate limits for the Analytics API are counted by the number of
    components called. One component is the combination of a specific endpoint
    with an address or other geographic level identifier. Value Report, Rental
    Report, and Value Analysis are rate limited based on number of HTTP requests
    in the time period.


    ### How different Analytics API requests count against the component rate
    limit:


    GET property/geocode


    - 1 endpoint

    - Only accepts 1 address

    - Counts as 1 component against the rate limit


    GET property/component_mget with 2 endpoints specified


    - 2 endpoints

    - Only accepts 1 address

    - Counts as 2 components against the rate limit


    POST property/geocode with 3 addresses in the body


    - 1 endpoint

    - 3 addresses in the body

    - Counts as 3 components against the rate limit


    POST property/component_mget with 4 endpoints specified and 4 addresses in
    the body


    - 4 endpoints

    - 4 addresses in the body

    - Counts as 16 components against the rate limit


    Custom response headers are returned from the API to indicate rate limit
    information:


    | Header Name           |
    Description

    ## Security


    TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 are supported. SSL is not supported.


    ## Test Lists


    The following endpoints produce lists of items that can be used, in
    conjunction with your test credentials, to make test requests. Any item in
    the list will return valid data when passed to one of our endpoints.


    **Please obtain the real lists of test items from the live endpoints. The
    example responses shown to the right do not contain valid test items.**

    ## Response Codes and Errors


    The HouseCanary API is built leveraging the REST paradigm. Under normal
    conditions, the API will return a response with a 200 OK HTTP status code.
    If an error occurs, the response will contain the appropriate HTTP status
    code as described below.


    ### API Code and API Code Description


    Because a single request can include multiple items or multiple endpoints,
    each response section returned in a normal 200 response will contain its own
    `api_code` and `api_code_description` fields. These are used to identify
    business logic errors for those items. The following values may be returned:


    | API Code | API Code Description | Meaning                                 
    |

    | -------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------
    |

    | 0        | ok                   | Successfully retrieved data for the item
    |

    | 204      | no content           | Unable to retrieve data for the item    
    |


    We do not charge for sections returned with a 204 `api_code`.


    ### 400 - Missing required fields or incorrect request structure


    If one or more required fields for an endpoint are missing in the request, a
    400 Bad Request status code will be returned, and the response body will
    contain an explanation of the error.


    A common reason for a 400 response is missing required query parameters.


    We do not charge for requests that result in a response with a 400 status
    code.


    ### 401 - Authentication failure


    In the case of authentication failure, a _401 Unauthorized_ status code will
    be returned.


    _Note: In the case of an authentication failure, the system will return a
    401 without any explanation or description. Should you have any questions on
    an auth failure, please contact [HouseCanary technical
    support](https://support.housecanary.com/)._


    We do not charge for requests that result in a response with a 401 status
    code.


    ### 429 - Rate limit hit


    If your organization has made all the component requests allowed under your
    organization’s rate limit, a 429 Too Many Requests status code will be
    returned, and the response body will contain the message shown to the right.
    If you run into this error, you must wait until the UTC epoch time returned
    in the X-RateLimit-Reset header. If you need a large volume of data,
    HouseCanary is able to support _significantly_ higher rate limits for
    enterprise customers. [Contact us](https://support.housecanary.com/) for
    more details.


    We do not charge for requests that result in a response with a 429 status
    code.

            security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta
            is calculated by comparing the security's or portfolio's price
            movement to the movement of the market index. A beta of 1 indicates
            that the security's price moves with the market. A beta above 1
            indicates that the security's price is more volatile than the
            market, while a beta below 1 indicates that the security's price is

                If one or more required fields for an endpoint are missing in the request, a 400 Bad Request status code will be returned, and the response body will contain an explanation of the error.

                A common reason for a 400 response is missing required query parameters.

                We do not charge for requests that result in a response with a 400 status code.

                If your organization has made all the component requests allowed under your organization's rate limit, a `429 Too Many Requests` status code will be returned. If you run into this error, you must wait until the UTC epoch time returned in the `X-RateLimit-Reset header`. If you need a large volume of data, HouseCanary is able to support *significantly* higher rate limits for enterprise customers. [Contact us](https://support.housecanary.com) for more details.

      is sorted by record_date in ascending order by default, but the sorting

      'end' parameters can be used to limit the number of returned results and

      The data shows the dollar value of this property adjusted from its current
      AVM value to a desired date, either in the past or in the future.
      Adjustments are done by using HPI for block, block group, zipcode, MSA and
      state. All five adjustments are returned in the response. If the optional
      parameters client_value and client_date are given, the response will also
      show adjustment from that date and value to the same desired date.

      This endpoint provides a forecast time series of monthly block-median data
      for dollar value and dollar value per sq ft. The values are forecast one
      year into the future. You can specify a desired property type using the
      `property_type` request parameter. The default is SFD. You can also
      specify the `order`, `limit`, `start`, and `end` request parameters. The
      `order` parameter determines the chronological order to sort result items.
      The `limit` parameter sets the maximum integer number of result items to
      return. The `start` and `end` parameters set the beginning and ending date
      limits for result items, respectively, based on month in ISO 8601 format
      (e.g., 2015-01-01).

    description: >-
      This endpoint provides a forecast time series of monthly block-median data
      for dollar value and dollar value per sq ft. The values are forecast one
      year into the future. You can specify a desired property type using the
      `property_type` request parameter. The default is SFD. You can also
      specify the `order`, `limit`, `start`, and `end` request parameters. The
      `order` parameter determines the chronological order to sort result items.
      The `limit` parameter sets the maximum integer number of result items to
      return. The `start` and `end` parameters set the beginning and ending date
      limits for result items, respectively, based on month in ISO 8601 format
      (e.g., 2015-01-01).

      This endpoint provides a historical time series of monthly block-median
      data for dollar value and dollar value per sq ft. You can specify a
      desired property type using the `property_type` request parameter. The
      default is SFD. You can also specify the `order`, `limit`, `start`, and
      `end` request parameters. The `order` parameter determines the
      chronological order to sort result items. The `limit` parameter sets the
      maximum integer number of result items to return. The `start` and `end`
      parameters set the beginning and ending date limits for result items,
      respectively, based on month in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2015-01-01). Values
      may go back as far as 1985

    description: >-
      This endpoint provides a historical time series of monthly block-median
      data for dollar value and dollar value per sq ft. You can specify a
      desired property type using the `property_type` request parameter. The
      default is SFD. You can also specify the `order`, `limit`, `start`, and
      `end` request parameters. The `order` parameter determines the
      chronological order to sort result items. The `limit` parameter sets the
      maximum integer number of result items to return. The `start` and `end`
      parameters set the beginning and ending date limits for result items,
      respectively, based on month in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2015-01-01). Values
      may go back as far as 1985

      This endpoint provides a forecast time series of monthly blockgroup-median
      data for dollar value and dollar value per sq ft. The values are forecast
      one year into the future. You can specify a desired property type using
      the `property_type` request parameter. The default is SFD. You can also
      specify the `order`, `limit`, `start`, and `end` request parameters. The
      `order` parameter determines the chronological order to sort result items.
      The `limit` parameter sets the maximum integer number of result items to
      return. The `start` and `end` parameters set the beginning and ending date
      limits for result items, respectively, based on month in ISO 8601 format
      (e.g., 2015-01-01).

    description: >-
      This endpoint provides a forecast time series of monthly blockgroup-median
      data for dollar value and dollar value per sq ft. The values are forecast
      one year into the future. You can specify a desired property type using
      the `property_type` request parameter. The default is SFD. You can also
      specify the `order`, `limit`, `start`, and `end` request parameters. The
      `order` parameter determines the chronological order to sort result items.
      The `limit` parameter sets the maximum integer number of result items to
      return. The `start` and `end` parameters set the beginning and ending date
      limits for result items, respectively, based on month in ISO 8601 format
      (e.g., 2015-01-01).

    description: >-
      The blockgroup/component_mget endpoint allows you to retrieve data from
      multiple Analytics API blockgroup-level endpoints in one request. Provide
      a comma separated list of blockgroup endpoint names in the components
      query parameter to specify which block endpoints you would like to
      include. This endpoint does not have a predefined schema because the
      response will depend on the specific endpoints that are included in the
